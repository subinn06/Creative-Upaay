✨Features

Pixel-perfect UI based on the provided Figma design.

Kanban Board Layout with three sections:
To Do
On Progress
Done

Task Management:
Add, edit, delete tasks
Move tasks between columns (via dropdown or drag-and-drop)
Filter tasks by category, priority, and due date
Search by title/description

Redux for State Management: centralized state handling.

Persistence with Local Storage: tasks are saved and reloaded on refresh.

Bonus: Drag-and-drop task reordering (powered by react-beautiful-dnd).

⚙️Technologies Used

Frontend Framework: React.js

UI Library: Material-UI (MUI)

State Management: Redux

Persistence: Local Storage

Drag & Drop: react-beautiful-dnd

Styling: MUI components + custom styles


⚡Known Limitations

Members Feature: Task cards show members count, but assigning members is not yet implemented.

Sidebar Navigation: The navigation items (Home, Messages, etc.) are static and non-functional.

Project Switching: Sidebar lists projects visually, but only the Mobile App project is active.

Topbar Search: A global search bar exists, but it is not yet wired to the Redux filters (use the FilterBar / ProjectHeader filters instead).

StrictMode Compatibility: react-beautiful-dnd may throw warnings/errors under React 18 StrictMode. Disabling StrictMode in index.js or using prefixed droppableIds solves this.


📝Future Improvements

Add member assignment to tasks.

Connect sidebar navigation to routes.

Wire up Topbar global search.

Dark/light mode toggle.

Improve mobile responsiveness further.
